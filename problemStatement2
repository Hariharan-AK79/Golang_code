package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
	for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
		go func() {
			for f := range cnp {
				f()
			}
		}()
	}
	cnp <- func() {
		fmt.Println("HERE1")
	}
	fmt.Println("Hello")
}



Output : 

Hello 


Here the go codes executing only the fmt.Println("Hello")
The channel which is been created dosent execute because the function func() is not having any data type
So its not getting executed for the value cnp
